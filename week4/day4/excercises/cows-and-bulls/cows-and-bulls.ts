// Cows and Bulls
// Create a class what is capable of playing exactly one game of Cows and Bulls (CAB). 
// The player have to guess a 4 digit number. For every digit that the player guessed correctly in the correct place, 
// they have a “cow”. For every digit the player guessed correctly in the wrong place is a “bull.” 
// If the player types a number that does not exist, that quess will not have any result.

// Example: If the number to be found is "7624" and the player types "7296", the result is: "1 cow, 2 bull".

// The CAB object should have a random 4 digit number, which is the goal to guess.
// The CAB object should have a state where the game state is stored (playing, finished).
// The CAB object should have a counter where it counts the guesses.
// The CAB object should have a guess method, which returns a string of the guess result
// All methods, including constructor should be tested
